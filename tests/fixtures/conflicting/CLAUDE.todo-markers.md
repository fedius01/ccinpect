# Project with TODO markers

## Overview
This project is a web application for managing tasks.

## Setup
- TODO: Add proper setup instructions
- FIXME: The database connection string is hardcoded
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Architecture
The application uses a standard MVC pattern.

- HACK: The auth module bypasses validation temporarily
- XXX: This needs a complete rewrite

## Code Examples

Here's how to use the API:

```typescript
// TODO: This is just an example, not a real marker
const result = await api.fetch();
// FIXME: example fixme in code block
```

## Deployment
- TEMP: Using development keys in staging
- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual deployment instructions

## Notes
- The word placeholder in a sentence is fine
- This is not a placeholder for anything specific
